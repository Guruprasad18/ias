# Overview 

Graphics Subsystem

The mission of the Graphics Subsystem is to provide high-quality visual feedback in a 
multi-display automotive environment.<br>

The Graphic Subsystem delivers the capabilities to meet the automotive requirements for 
visual feedback in the vehicle interior. This means providing in-time visualization to driver, 
passenger & rear seat entertainment from sources like internet, 3rd party applications & 
devices, navigation & DVD/Blue ray players where source and sink can be front units and 
rear seat units in any configuration.<br>

A challenge is providing a suitable data transfer rate if passengers use more than one data 
source.<br>

There are natural cross dependencies between the Graphic Subsystem, the system as a 
whole and provided hardware / drivers: Due to the fact, that some graphic calculations & 
driver calls are done on the CPU, the final graphic performance is both, limited by the 
chosen hardware & limited by current CPU and GPU load of the running system.
In general increasing screen sizes, dual view screens and extensions to head-up displays 
and in-cluster displays sharing GPU among several applications with different output to 
parts of displays (split screen) or multiple displays will increase requirements regarding 
computational power and possibility to share it.
