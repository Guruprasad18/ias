		<description summary="IAS display input manager">
			In automotive settings it is quite common to have the same set
			of surfaces be displayed in different inputs during different
			modes of operation (e.g., "home screen" vs task switcher vs
			tiled view).  This interface allows clients to control/monitor
			the usage of different display inputs.

		<event name="input">
			<description summary="Advertises a supported input">
				A input event is raised for each input that the input
				manager is aware of.  This includes both built-in inputs
				and plugin-loaded inputs.  inputs are identified by ID
				number.  ID's less than 64 are reserved for builtin inputs
				provided by the IAS shell.  ID's 64 and above are available
				for use by inputs loaded by plugin (the ID assignment can
				be configured in the IAS configuration file).  ID 0 will always
				refer to the 'default' input (sometimes called the "home
				screen") in which surfaces are organized exactly as specified
				by their internal geometry.
